### Data
You can find simulated example datasets (1189 units, 5 repeated-measures) on [Github](https://github.com/ellenhamaker/RI-CLPM/tree/master/data) to get hands-on experience with this modeling approach. The example data are motivated by @Narmandakh2020 who obtained five waves of data from 1189 adolescents on their sleep problems and anxiety over 15 years.
